# Music Webms Thread Scrapper
A 4chan scapper, using basc-py4chan, that gathers webms from ygyl threads.

## Current features:
    - allows user to get a file containing links to webms in ygyl threads on /wsg/
    - allows user to get non-webm links in ygyl threads on /wsg/

## Possible additions:
    - allow user to select what board(s) to choose from
    - allow user to select what file type(s) to save
    - allow user to select what keyword(s) to search for

## Required to run:
    - basc-py4chan module. https://github.com/bibanon/BASC-py4chan
    - only tested on 3.6.7 . Will probably work on most 3.x. Let me know if any problems occur
